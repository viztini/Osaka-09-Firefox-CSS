# Osaka ’09 — A Firefox CSS Theme

![banner](./osaka.png)

Firefox CSS Theme for retro Gentoo Linux distro, Osaka '09

This theme is built on top of three excellent community projects, remixing their ideas into something new while keeping the spirit of each:

- **[AeroFirefox](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20AeroFirefox)** — for its glassy translucency and polished Windows‑style chrome  
- **[RetroThemesFirefox](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20RetroThemesFirefox)** — for its dedication to nostalgic UI design  
- **[Modoki‑Firefox](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20Modoki%E2%80%91Firefox)** — for its clean structure and modular approach to styling
